          <h2>About Kevin</h2>
        </header>
        <p>After college I began working as a salesman for some
		fortune 500 companies. I was able to develop my public
		speaking skills through them and as a result I gain some
		self confidence in myself and I began to think bigger.</p>
		<p>As a student at Thinkful, my goal is to be able to have
		the skills I need in order to become a sucessful partner or
		run a small business using my skills I learned from doing
		sales. Using the new skills I learn from Thinkful will be
		me being much closer to my goal of being independent.</p>
		<p>If you are looking for a contractor, a new developer
		to hire, or a partner then please feel free to reach out!
		I am always excited to meet new people and work with other
		developers or new partners.</p>
